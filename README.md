# Circus

## Introduction
Circus provides an easy deployment mechanism for applications that need
to be deployed on top of a server grid. Designed to work on top of any
Debian-capable platform (eg Ubuntu), grid nodes can be deployed on top of
either local nodes running on bare-metal servers; or on top of cloud servers
with hosts such as EC2, Rackspace Cloud, Slicehost, Linode and so on.

Extensive documentation on installation, use and extension are available at
http://deployacircus.com.
