# The Circus Fast Track
To begin deploying with Circus, you'll need to configure at least one deployment node running a Clown, and have the management tools installed.

The fast track will walk you through setting up a node, getting the tools in place, and running some applications on top of Circus. Once you've completed it, you should be comfortable with building more Circus nodes, preparing your application to run on a Circus a node, and doing the deployment.

Feedback on the documentation provided here is always welcome - please send any remarks, notes or bugs our way.
