# Frequently Asked Questions

## How is this different to Chef or Puppet?
The idea is that Chef and/or Puppet should be used in tandem with Circus. Chef and
Puppet can focus on configuring your baseline infrastructure (language environments,
network configurations, authentication), and Circus handles deploying your application
on top.

Any deployment solution built on top of Chef or Puppet would require custom scripting
to handle the building and bundling of your applications - and it is this custom code
that Circus is aiming to remove.

## How is Circus licensed?
Circus is licensed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a>. See the <a href="/license.html">license page</a>.
