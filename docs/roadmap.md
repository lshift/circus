# Roadmap
This document details the currently planned Roadmap for Circus. Nothing on this list is set on stone - it simply represents the best current idea for what we'd like to do in the future. Comments/suggestions/assistance welcome.

## Short term
 * Ensure initial documentation is in a good enough position to get users moving
 * Simplify initial install processes
 * Make basic plumbing commands as easy to use as possible
 * Accelerate gem bundling

## Medium term
 * Bigtop for managing deployment balancing across multiple nodes

## Long term
 * Still to come...
